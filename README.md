# Project Selling line: 
* This Project is about Cars, Branding Car have some categories also. Users can update or see details and can add car from add to cart button. Also user can add a car from Add Car page.
* Solved Problem: When I try to update any car information I was facing a problem, I could not update all information together from server. Then I fixed that problem and now user can update car's information successfully.

Then 6 Cars Brand name and Brand image, when users clicked on a brand card page redirect a route where have a slider with 3 images and same brand car showing at this slider and at least 4 cards showing under the slider. Every card have cars name, information and specially there is two buttons named details and update. On Clicking details button, display clicked cars image, details and a add to cart button so that users can add cars as their choice. After adding cars, if users wanna show his/her car he/she can go to the my cart page and can show all cars that he/she added before and also can delete car because my car pages, every car have details and also a delete button.

* When users clicked on the update button, page redirect him a update form page. Also have authentication facilities so if anyone added, show details about car he have to be logged in.
